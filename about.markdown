Hello!

I'm a software developer working in the Visual Effects industry, I lead a team of amazing software developers at Industrial Light & Magic where we make movies like Star Wars and Avengers come to life with computer generated graphics.

In this website I share some rambles about technology and leadership. 

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/andrecasp), [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrecasp/) and [Github](https://github.com/andrecp), if you prefer you can also [email](mailto:andre@andrecp.com) me.
